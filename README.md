# GamePen

A social platform for indie game developers and artists to connect, collaborate, and share their work.

## Who was this project built for?

This project was specifically designed for **solo indie creators** who struggle to find the right collaborators. As an artist passionate about games, I experienced firsthand the overwhelming challenge of juggling all roles‚Äîart, design, development, and audience management‚Äîwhile trying to build something meaningful.

### Target Audience:
- **Solo game developers** looking for artists who match their vision
- **Game artists** seeking development projects that align with their style
- **Indie creators** wanting to build authentic connections without corporate noise
- **Passionate gamers** who want to contribute to the indie game community

## Why was GamePen created?

### The Problem:
Indie creators often struggle to find the right people to work with. Big platforms like ArtStation or DeviantArt are great for showcasing work, but they don't focus on helping solo developers and artists actually connect and collaborate. These platforms are dominated by large studios and established professionals, making it difficult for indie creators to stand out and find meaningful partnerships.

### The Solution:
GamePen fills this gap by providing a dedicated space where indie creators can:
- Find collaborators who match their style and vision
- Share work in genre-specific communities
- Build meaningful connections with other creators
- Avoid getting lost among bigger studio content
- Focus on genuine collaboration rather than just showcasing

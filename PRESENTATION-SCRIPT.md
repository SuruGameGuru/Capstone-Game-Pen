# GamePen - Project Presentation Script

## Part 1: Introduction

### Opening Statement
"Good [morning/afternoon/evening], I'm excited to present **GamePen**, a full-stack social gaming platform that connects gamers through art, discussion, and real-time communication."

### Project Overview
**GamePen** is a comprehensive web application built with the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) that serves as a social hub for gamers. The platform allows users to:

- **Share and discover gaming art** through an intuitive upload and gallery system
- **Connect with other gamers** through real-time chat channels organized by game genres
- **Build communities** through friend systems and direct messaging
- **Express themselves** through customizable profiles with banners and descriptions

### Problem Statement
Gamers often struggle to find like-minded communities and share their gaming experiences beyond just gameplay. Traditional social media platforms don't cater specifically to gaming culture, and existing gaming platforms lack comprehensive social features.

### Solution
GamePen bridges this gap by providing:
- **Genre-specific chat channels** for focused discussions
- **Art sharing capabilities** for creative expression
- **Social networking features** for community building
- **Real-time communication** for immediate interaction
